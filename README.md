# About me
Hi, my name is thxr. I am student and an ethusiast for Cyber Security. 

This is a place of trying, failing and learning. Hopefully one may see a journey of someone who improves his programming skills by programming. 

The plan is to have some kind of relevance regading CySec in every project. We will see.
